# **Challenge 2 - API Automation Testing - Airport Gap**  

The challenge is to create and containerize a test automation framework for the **Airport Gap API** application.  

## **Task & Requirements**  

### **Requirements**  

#### **Framework Requirements**  

- Use Python with `requests` and `pytest`.  
- Implement test data management.  
- Implement token-based authentication.  
- Validate data for airport IATA codes.  
- Implement distance calculation verification.  
- Implement error handling.  
- Implement non-functional tests.  
- Implement reporting.  

#### **Standards and Code Quality**

- Add test documentation.
- Project setup instructions.  
- Test execution guidelines.  
- Environment configuration.  
- Troubleshooting guide.  
- Follow **PEP 8** standards.  

### **Task**  

Create an automated test suite for **[Airport Gap API](https://airportgap.com/)** that includes:  

- [ ] Testing of all endpoints  
- [ ] Token-based authentication implementation  
- [ ] Data validation for airport IATA codes  
- [ ] Distance calculation verification  
- [ ] Error handling  

#### **Identified Test Cases**

### **Assumptions and Justifications**  

...

### **Design**  

- The test framework will follow a modular structure; more specifically I will use a POM (Page Object Model) design pattern.  
- Test data will be managed externally to allow for easy updates.  
- Authentication handling will be implemented for protected endpoints.  
- Reporting will be integrated for test execution insights.  

## **Setup Instructions**  

Since you are pulling this repository, I'm going to assume you are familiar with Git and have it installed on your machine. If not, you can download it **[here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.  

You'll also need a couple of other things installed on your machine. See below for the prerequisites.  

### **Prerequisites**  

- Python 3.13  
- Pip 25.0  
- Docker  
- Docker Compose  
- Git  

## **Trouble Shooting Guide**

Any issues common issues you may encounter/what I encountered and how I resolved them will be included in this section of the document.
